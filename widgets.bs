Introduction {#introduction}
=====================

This document describes the Web Standard for Widgets, which is a set of guidelines for creating and using widgets. Widgets are small, self-contained applications that can be embedded in a web page. They are typically used to provide additional functionality to a web page, such as a calendar, a weather forecast, or a news ticker.

The Web Standard for Widgets is based on the following principles:

- Openness: The Web Standard for Widgets is open and free to use. Anyone can create or use widgets that conform to the standard.
- Extensibility: The Web Standard for Widgets is extensible. This means that new widgets can be added to the standard without affecting existing widgets.
- Compatibility: The Web Standard for Widgets is designed to be compatible with existing web technologies. This means that widgets can be used in web pages that are created using standard web technologies.

The Web Standard for Widgets is a work in progress. We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement. Please contact us at [email protected] if you have any questions or comments.
